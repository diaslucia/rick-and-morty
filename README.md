# Rick and Morty Challenge 👴👦

This page displays a list of Rick & Morty characters recovered from a public API. 
You can see the character's details as well as the list of episodes where they appeared.

The character's name is sorted ascending and you have the option to sort them by specie.
(This command only sorts the characters per page.)

You can also try the search bar and navigate through the list using pagination!
